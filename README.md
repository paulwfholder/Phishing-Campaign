## Introduction
Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats. This project helps organizations assess their preparedness against such threats by simulating phishing attacks and analyzing the results to improve employee awareness and response.

## Features
- Design and deploy phishing emails
- Track email open rates and click-through rates
- Analyze user responses
- Provide feedback and training to users
- Generate detailed reports on campaign effectiveness

## Tools and Technologies
- **Gophish**: Open-source phishing framework for creating and managing phishing campaigns
- **Python**: Scripting for automation and data analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **SMTP Server**: Sending phishing emails
- **HTML/CSS**: Crafting phishing email templates
- **SQLite**: Database for storing campaign data
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis and report generation

## Methodology
1. **Planning**:
    - Define the scope and objectives of the phishing campaign.
    - Identify target groups within the organization.
    - Develop realistic phishing scenarios.
2. **Designing Phishing Emails**:
    - Create email templates using HTML/CSS.
    - Customize the content to match the scenarios.
3. **Setting Up Gophish**:
    - Install and configure Gophish.
    - Create a new phishing campaign in Gophish.
    - Import the email templates and target list.
4. **Launching the Campaign**:
    - Schedule the campaign to run at a specific time.
    - Monitor the campaign for delivery and response rates.
5. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
    - Extract data from Gophish.
    - Use Python and Pandas to analyze the data.
    - Generate reports on user interactions and campaign effectiveness.
6. **Training and Feedback**:
